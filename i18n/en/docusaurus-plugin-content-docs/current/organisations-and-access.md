## Who sends the invitation?

The platform administrator invites the **first administrator** of a new
organisation. Once accepted, that administrator can invite colleagues only
within their organisation, selecting each person's role and permitted Sites.

If you already belong to an organisation, ask its administrator for an
invitation. If you are the first person from a new organisation, contact the
GrideX team.

## Roles and Sites

| Role | Scope |
| --- | --- |
| Platform administrator | Invites the first administrator of a new organisation. |
| Organisation administrator | Manages people and permitted Sites within their own organisation. |
| Viewer | Reads authorised data. |
| Operator | Performs authorised operational actions. |
| Energy manager | Works with authorised strategies and settings. |
| Integrator | Works with authorised device settings. |

Each customer organisation has a separate OpenRemote space. Site access is
explicit: membership without a Site grant does not expose another customer's
data. The current member invitation flow cannot delegate the organisation
administrator role.

## For administrators

Use Customers & contracts → Users & invitations in the portal. A new
organisation requires a name, unique short code and first administrator's
email. Permissions activate only after acceptance and verification. First
real customer delivery and acceptance have **not yet been verified end to
end**; do not confuse a sent email with an activated organisation.
